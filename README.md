# FTQuant

FTQuant is a derivative pricing terminal using Monte-Carlo simulations with it's own language and ability to solve PDEs. Possible ways to improve the implementation:

* Multithreaded Monte-Carlo;
* More feature-rich set of derivatives (e.g. structural products like autocall);
* More models (Heston stochastic volatility model, local stochastic volatility models).

Documentation for the code is avaliable [here](https://artemysazonov.github.io/FTQuant/index.html).
